#  Visual HEIFLOW (VHF)
## Description
   VHF is a comprehensive graphical modeling environment for integrated hydrological modeling. Currently, VHF is specially designed for an integrated ecological-hydrological model called HIEFLOW, but it can be easily extended to support other hydrological models. 
   
   VHF is Written by the HEIFLOW Team (see the [CONTRIBUTORS](https://github.com/DeepHydro/VHF/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS) file) at [School of Environmental Science and Engineering](http://ese.sustc.edu.cn/en/), [Southern University of Science and Technology](http://www.sustc.edu.cn/en/).

## Features
* Streamlines the entire integrated modeling procedure, from data preparation at the very beginning to visualization and analysis of modeling results, in a uniform environment.
* Provides complete access to the relational database, as well as mapping, and 3D visualization tools to support the model development process. It allow users to take advantage of all types of GIS data available for hydrologic modeling.
* Uses a generic multivariable-space-time data cube model, which enables the system to efficiently handle large
time-series datasets over a large spatial domain. 
* Allows updating the land use input at user-specified time points without manual interruption and therefore enables the model to directly simulate the hydrological effects of changing land use.
