            <summary>
            Many SharpDevelop.Dom methods take a file name, which is really just a unique identifier
            for a file - Dom methods don't try to access code files on disk, so the file does not have
            to exist.
            SharpDevelop itself uses internal names of the kind "[randomId]/Class1.cs" to support
            code-completion in unsaved files.

            ICSharpCode.SharpDevelop.Dom was created by extracting code from ICSharpCode.SharpDevelop.dll.
            There are a few static method calls that refer to GUI code or the code for keeping the parse
            information. These calls have to be implemented by the application hosting
            ICSharpCode.SharpDevelop.Dom by settings static fields with a delegate to their method
            implementation.
